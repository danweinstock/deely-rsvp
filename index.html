					<h3 class="story-title">First Date</h3>
					<div class="story-text">
						In 2011, a certain social worker messaged a handsome man on JDate. Her profile peaked his interest with her slap-stick movie quotes and his curiosity about what the heck a "harm-reductionist vegetarian" was. She was drawn in by his knowledge of random facts, his sweetness and great smile. After a month of waiting (while Neely took forever to move into her new place), it was finally time for their first date. They were excited to meet. They went to Snakes and Lattes, had fantastic hot chocolate, played some board games and talked until late. Towards the end of the date, Neely decided to cut to the chase and ask Dan if he wanted to go on another date and he said yes. That was the beginning.

						Over the last 5 years they have had fun and lots of laughs together, whether it's singing and dancing to musicals around the apartment, cooking, their annual bike rides that go awry, watching fireworks from their balcony on any given national holiday, roadtrips out East and West or just chilling on the couch watching their latest series.

					<h3 class="story-title">The Proposal</h3>
					<div class="story-text">August 28, 2016 -  Neely, the dog lover, suggested that it would be cute that when Dan proposed he do so with a puppy. Dan, being the practical guy that he is, went for the compromise and had a custom stuffed animal made to look just like her childhood dog, Kody. During one of their relaxing Saturday mornings, while watching "The Wedding Planner" for the 20th time, Dan felt that the time was right. He brought the "dog" down with the ring tied around it's neck and presented her "puppy" while on one knee. Even though she knew it was coming, she still cried, as she does, and said yes! </div>

				<p>If you clicked on the Registry page, you're probably looking for ideas for wedding gifts. While this is not necessary, Neely and Dan would appreciate every gesture.<br/></p>

				<p>They live in a small 750 square foot condo. They have everything they could possibly need. More than “things”, Neely and Dan would appreciate a contribution to some important upcoming life events - like their an upcoming honeymoon, one day being able to buy a bigger place, and starting a family!</p>
